Circular design lighting objects were created after the workshop I held at the Mikser Balkan Design Festival in May 2024. The workshop was about repurposing waste and discarded materials, giving it new life in the form of lighting objects. These lighting objects are what was yielded after impressions from the workshop settled down. By combining discarded materials from the construction waste sites with some everyday materials such as colorful cords, metal mesh and LED tapes, an interesting blend of old, worn out and new, colorful elements is being created.
