A friend asked a group of friends to help him reconstruct and readapt the space of his bar and restaurant. Finances and time were very narrow and strict, we had to reuse a lot of elements from the previous space and the place had to reopen in a very short amount time. The position of the bar shifted to be parallel to the back wall in order to free up the space for chatting, dancing. Low and relaxing seating area was achieved by introducing new orange seating, making this lower part of the restaurant relaxed in character. The whole space was divided to host a fine dining zone in the upper part of the ground floor. The barrier between two zones was achieved by planting some plants in the black metal pots, creating a see-through barrier but without blocking the sight between two zones of the restaurant. Using low-cost materials found in a local building supply store was helpful financially but also created interesting visual effects. One of them is the green undulating plates originally used for roofing, and now acting as the cover for the old ceiling which was in ruins. Another material we used are thin copper sheets to cover larger areas of walls and some parts of gypsum ceiling, adding the visually stunning effect to the whole space. We drew on all of the copper sheets with whatever we could find to create imprints, in order to give a personal touch to this design decision. Some of the old metal lamps were readjusted to serve as lighting above the bar. The pink and red LED lights were used as an easy fix for creating a visual change but with spending less.
