The client asked for the project of a house in his home village in western Serbia. The house is placed on a steep terrain which allows for the basement to be partially underground. It holds a garage and an area for play and leisure. The ground floor consists of daily and nightly areas, and the living room exits onto a large terrace overlooking the woods. The exterior of the house strives to harmonize with the surrounding architecture in its style, by introducing stone plinth in the lower part of the house. In the ground floor the woodden windows and shutters are carefully designed with lots of rustic details.
