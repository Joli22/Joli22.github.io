Neighborhood’s Waste-Hubs. Trying to use as much of the solid waste that comes out from the city and give it another life in shape of something else – something usable by all citizens of Gdynia. In this competition we wanted to address the issue of waste production which resulted from the world of over-consumption. By synchronizing with initiatives from the city who already take care of the waste collection and categorization, we want to build so called Waste-Hubs near the locations of collected waste and provide the closest neighborhoods with spaces of workshops where they can participate to transform this waste into something usable. These can be urban furniture, homeless shelters, bookshelves or tents, anything usable for the city’s public spaces, or for the residents themselves. Such new use of waste can be ever evolving because the more people get involved in this idea the more ideas will come out on how to transform the collected waste.
