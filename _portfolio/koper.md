Series of workshops organized around a 10-day summer school with architects, architecture students, artists, landscape architects, engineers. The center of the workshop is the city of Koper, Slovenia. The charming old town of Koper is being deserted by its residents as the consequence of the fast-paced urban development happening outside the old city walls in the form of new shopping malls, garages, huge supermarkets, generic promenades and parks that resemble waste lands. The idea of the summer school was to spend time in the city and act upon it with series of micro interventions which would hopefully activate the old city and invite people to spend their time there, rather than in the newly built malls. Our immediate intervention was carrying the old fishing net around various locations in and out of the old city and creating a happening around it. The old fishing net served as a metaphor for a public pavilion which could host different activities and it could be transportable in order to activate different locations around the city.
