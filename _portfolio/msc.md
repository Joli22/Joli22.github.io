Informal settlements and informal ways of living in Western Balkan countries may vary from illegal additions to existing buildings to whole informal settlements, and it doesn’t necessarily associate only with the poorer layers of population. The informality in this geo-political area slips through many layers of the urban life, usually in the sole settlements, but it finds its ways in the institutional levels as well. This project focuses on the reality of the single informal settlement mainly inhabited by Roma population in Podgorica, Montenegro in relation to a decade long interference (and lack of interference) of the authorities and institutions regarding this topic. By applying different tactics, from thorough research on site, interviewing residents, contacting NGO’s, Red Cross, institutions, UN headquarters and different actors involved with the area since its beginnings until the moment of thesis creation I tried to make a synthesis of conclusions and make a proposal which could be considered as a compromise between the informal and the formal ways of dealing with this situation. In response to that, my general concept is based on this duality and on different realities of the two streams (the institutional, and the one from site) which is represented in the form of the timeline. This kind of approach helped to organize events and decisions that happened around this space in the past, and gave me thorough insight based on which I proposed my design. I tried to respect both realities regarding this space and its specific situation, being that in the moment of thesis making it was hardly possible that one current will dominate and erase the presence of the other (the institutions take over and eliminate the informal settlement). That’s why the result is a compromising design, which includes both currents and connects them in the form of a ‘line’ consisted of educational, economic, playful activities and space activators.
