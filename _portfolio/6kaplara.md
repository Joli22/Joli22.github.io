This is an ongoing project of the refurbishment of an apartment in Belgrade. In accordance with clients' needs the daily area is designed as open space containing kitchen, dining and living area, a library, and a TV stand. The center of attention is the red sofa standing out in the mainly white and oak setting that surrounds it, with occasional smaller yellow furniture pieces. Clients also asked for more peripheral sources of light, rather than fewer central ones. The constructive column in the middle of the space is covered in mirror to lighten its presence.
