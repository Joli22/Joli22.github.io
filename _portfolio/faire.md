'Ballancoire' is a piece of urban furniture imagined to question the behaviour of older generation in playground with their grandchildren. Instead of sitting and watching the younger play, they could participate in the act of playing. The aim of this creation is to make both generation interact in playtime. It is imagined to function as a system of three bicycle wheels interconnected. The wheels are different sizes and each movement from the grandparents influences the rocking of the children's swing. This proposition was made as a response to the 'Faire Paris' competition we did in collaboration with Colectivo Mel.
