This is an ongoing project of the total refurbishment of an apartment in Block 8a in Belgrade. The initially segmented apartment has turned an open space project following the wishes of the client. The floor area of 60m2 is covered in natural oak herringbone parquet, with almost no partition walls. The kitchen and dining area as well as the living area are connected visually, and the future sleeping area is imagined to be separated by a moving partition. The client couldn't decide between having a recammier sofa in the dining area or puffy chairs so we experimented with both options. As for the color pallette, we opted for some anthracite & white interior with some pale green doors and kitchen details. The backsplash kitchen wall will be handpainted white drawing on an antrhracite surface. The apartment is placed on an 11th floor and posseses a 20m2 balcony which is partially covered and roofed with glass panels. One of our first imaginations was for the terrace to hold an antique bath tub for the client to enjoy above the noisy city in the surroundings.
