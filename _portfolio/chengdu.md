This project is an outcome of the group project on urban planning in a new part of a town in Chengdu where an artificial lake is created and the city is concentrated around it. The public bathhouse project comes out as an individual project tackling the limits and usage of public spaces in Chinese cities, and the architecture that shapes them. In this project the water breaks the plots where the bathhouse buildings are placed. The reason for this outcome is to avoid the situation where one building dominates a square, but break the whole area into smaller plots in order to achieve a more human-scale sized built environment and gain an easier accessibility for all users.
